<p>Inspired by the issue of stunted growth (a critical health problem that permanently damages the physical and cognitive capabilities of 1 in every 3 Indonesian children), our team built a web app that aids the Indonesian government and healthcare organizations to identify the optimal locations for setting up nutrition centers in a district/area for maximum outreach to combat this issue.</p>
